    Psalm 84:11
        For the Lord God is a sun and shield; The Lord gives grace and glory; No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly.
    Romans 8:32
        He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?
    Mark 10:29-30
        Jesus said, "Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms,
        for My sake and for the gospel's sake, but that he shall receive a hundred times as much now in the present age,
        houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.'''

Oh man you don't know half of it, you'll lose your faith, your capacity for joy in Christ!
1 Peter 2:11 (war on soul) Abstain from fleshly lusts that wage war against your soul.
Mark 4:19
The desire for other things enters in and chokes the word and it becomes unfruitful.

You'll be dead inside unable to comprehend the light of God. Imagine losing all that makes you who you are. You are a child
of God. That's what makes you bruh. If you lose that, what will you be? Dead is what you shall be! Dead as the dodo.
If you go away from He who created you, if you trample the gift of salvation which you were given and regard it useless,
only an expectation of fire remains.

Titus 2:14
    Christ gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.
1 Peter 1:18; 2:24
    You were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, [but with the precious blood of Christ]. He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed.
1 Corinthians 5:15
    He died for all, that they who live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf.
Hebrews 10:29
    How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?

Remember how many people count on you, how much you hate to disappoint God. Remember the work for God that needs to be done, and your mission
in this life. You are destined to fulfill the work of God, He chose you before you were born, He knew and loved you too.
Remember that this evil takes out love out of your heart, it empties you, makes you hate others and yourself. It robs you of joy and peace,
it hinders the work of God. You are growing more self-centered and you know it. It stops your growth in Christ, you become more and more immature.
You support the very thing condemning millions, to slavery, poverty, pain, death. You are becoming what you hate!
Stop what you are doing and immerse yourself in God, love him, He is more powerful than this. You think this has got the hold on you, think again fool! We serve He who created us,
He can unlock the secrets to the Omnitrix lol
But I know you won't do that..

Psalm 4:7
    Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More than when their grain and new wine abound.
Psalm 16:11
    Thou wilt make known to me the path of life; In Thy presence is fulness of joy; In Thy right hand there are pleasures forever.
Psalm 73:25-26
    Whom have I in heaven but Thee? And besides Thee, I desire nothing on earth.
    My flesh and my heart may fail, But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

You shouldn't make excuses, you should act on your faith in God
by getting on your knees and crying out to Him to lift this from you. Beg Him with fear and trembling to guide you and rescue you.
God is so much greater than this and you know it. Do not let the devil lie to you, do not let him consume you. Be sober, be watchful,
for he wants to devour you, he wants your faith gone, do you want your faith gone? I don't think so. Do not be foolish. Remember the
joys and treasures in Christ that far surpass this dung. I have not heard of a fool who was offered gold but rejected it for dung. Pray to your God!
